# Fal.ai Optimization with Vercel Best Practices

## Key Changes

### 1. Real-time Execution for Image Models

- **Image generation models** now use `fal.run()` for real-time execution
- This provides **up to 4x faster** performance compared to `fal.subscribe()`
- No queue waiting time for supported models

### 2. Queue-based Processing for Special Models

- Video generation models still use `fal.subscribe()` as they require queue processing:
  - `fal-ai/veo3/fast`
  - `fal-ai/kling-video/v2.1/standard/image-to-video`
  - `fal-ai/bytedance/seedance/v1/lite/image-to-video`
  - `easel-ai/fashion-photoshoot`

### 3. Proper Validation

- **Kling video model**: `image_url` is now properly validated as a required field
- Form shows validation error if image is not provided
- API returns 400 error with clear message if image_url is missing

### 4. Performance Benefits

- Style transfer model uses `fal.run()` for faster execution
- All standard text-to-image models use real-time execution
- Maintains compatibility with all existing features

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **fal.ai**: Using `fal.run()` for real-time execution where supported
2. **Error handling**: Proper validation and error messages
3. **Model-specific logic**: Each model type has optimized handling
4. **Configuration**: Proper fal client configuration with credentials
